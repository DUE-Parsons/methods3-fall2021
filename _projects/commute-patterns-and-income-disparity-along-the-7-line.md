For this project I used data available from the census bureau to show the median income by subway stop along the 7 line. This was to support my studio research on the 7 line and draw contrasts between the current changes in the far west side and the diverse, low income neighborhoods in Queens. In addition to showing the median income by subway stop I tried to show commute patterns to support the research on labour coming from Queens to the far west side to service Hudson Yards and the 'gated community' impact the new development has had.
